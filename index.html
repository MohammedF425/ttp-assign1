          <div class="left_column"> <h2>Fun Fact!</h2> While breast cancer is most commonly associated with women, it's important to note that men can also develop breast cancer, although it is rare. Men account for less than 1% of all breast cancer cases. Awareness of this fact helps to emphasize the importance of educating everyone, regardless of gender, about breast cancer risks, symptoms, and the significance of early detection.</div>
          <div class="main_column"> <h1>Breast Cancer</h1> Breast cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the breast tissue. It occurs when cells in the breast begin to grow uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Breast cancer is most commonly found in women, but it can also affect men, albeit at a much lower rate.
  
            There are several types of breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, and less common subtypes. Some breast cancers can be fueled by hormones like estrogen or progesterone, while others may involve the overexpression or amplification of the HER2 protein.
            
            Early detection is crucial for successful treatment and improved outcomes. Common methods of detection include self-examination, clinical breast exams, mammography, and other imaging techniques. If a suspicious lump or abnormality is found, further diagnostic tests, such as biopsies, may be performed to confirm the presence of cancer.
            
            Breast cancer treatment depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the type of breast cancer, hormone receptor status, and individual patient factors. Treatment options may include surgery (such as lumpectomy or mastectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these approaches. The goal of treatment is to remove or destroy the cancer cells, prevent recurrence, and preserve or restore the individual's overall health and quality of life.
            
            Breast cancer awareness campaigns have been instrumental in educating people about risk factors, early detection, and the importance of regular screenings. Risk factors for breast cancer include age, family history, certain gene mutations (e.g., BRCA1 and BRCA2), hormonal factors, obesity, and lifestyle choices. However, it's important to note that anyone can develop breast cancer, even without any known risk factors.
            
            Research and advancements in breast cancer treatment have improved survival rates significantly over the years. Ongoing efforts focus on further understanding the biology of breast cancer, developing targeted therapies, improving screening methods, and enhancing supportive care for individuals diagnosed with breast cancer.
            
            Support networks, patient advocacy groups, and organizations dedicated to breast cancer research and support play a vital role in providing resources, information, emotional support, and raising awareness about breast cancer and the importance of early detection.</div>
          <div class="right_column"> <h2>Fun Fact!</h2> Breast cancer awareness has become symbolized by the pink ribbon. The origin of the pink ribbon as a symbol for breast cancer awareness can be traced back to the early 1990s. The pink ribbon was initially handed out by Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a prominent breast cancer organization, during their Race for the Cure event. Since then, the pink ribbon has become an internationally recognized symbol representing solidarity, support, and awareness for breast cancer. It is widely used during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October and throughout the year to raise funds, spread awareness, and show support for individuals affected by breast cancer.</div>
